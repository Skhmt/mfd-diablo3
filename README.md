# mfd-diablo3

A Diablo 3 display for [MFD](https://github.com/Skhmt/mfd)

It basically holds down 1, 2, 3, or 4 for you until you toggle it off. Useful if you can't do the numpad trick due to not having a numpad.

## Installation

* Install [MFD](https://github.com/Skhmt/mfd)
* Go to `.../MFD/displays`
* Make a new folder called something like `Diablo 3`
* Put the contents of this repository into that folder
